# Polite HTTP server

This package exports a `Server` type which is a drop in replacement for
[`http.Server`][], but which will wait for long running HTTP/2 connections to
close before shutting down. This is a work around for [Go issue #29764][].

`Serve`, `ListenAndServe`, `ListenAndServeTLS` are not supported â€“ please use
`ServeTLS`.

See [godoc][].
